Transcript:
(00:01) hey guys today we have uh Raja lakmi moan and she is having four years of experience in Java and spring board and those who are interested to give same Mo interview please fill out the form below so hey hi hi lxmi Hi how are you I'm good thank you okay can you please introduce yourself and your recent project yes so I have completed my computer engineering in 2019 and po then I've been working since uh 2019 uh in companies like PCS scal Ag and zebra Technologies and yeah so my basically the role was involving uh Java vac
(00:38) development and since then I'm associated with Java spring MVC and uh spring Boot and uh yeah I'm just learning a bit more in these Technologies okay okay so can you tell me about your recent project you have worked on yeah sure so recent projects which I've worked on like uh I've made uh end to end appli ation from uh getting data from client through JSP to saving data in backend uh in database tables through hiet uh so back was project and U yeah like developing application screen okay so what type of application
(01:18) it was so basically it was involving spring MVC so we handled the code through model view controller uh yeah okay so it was based on MBC yes okay okay so uh which database you have used hyet yeah hiate was the framework yeah framework okay and okay so have you uh added transactional annotation anywhere um no it was uh the product was using like spring so we uh handled with the help of hibernate objects like session objects we created and criteria so criteria we wrote these statements yeah okay so uh how you optimize queries uh while
(02:11) fetching data or saving data anything uh so can you please tell me optimize in the sense like uh we used to put indexing whereever required so that it will like reduce the load backend uh like fetching while fetching the results it would be helpful for us so used index and we also in is this micros service based or monolitic application no it was monolithic monolithic architecture okay so it's for client or internal project no it was for client uh we work for okay okay okay so can you also for interacting with the third
(02:56) party so we use so like where us where we used to send the data in the form of XML so we used to convert Java to XML through jsb libraries and we used to communicate with so what was the complex thing you have built uh in this project like the complex feature or changes complex feature as in I was um given the responsibility for developing U certain module screens uh so that I is like I built using JSP Java and spring yeah okay okay so you must added packages uh right while creating working on this project and inside packages uh we have uh
(03:43) classes and all right can you tell me the use uh case of packages like why do we use then yeah so basically packages what we do is that suppose we have classes having same name then we cannot put them U like it would be it would be redundant for the compiler to know so what happens that if we put the same name classes in different packages then it would be very easy for the compiler to understand which class from which package has been called so it actually solves the name naming conventions like naming versions
(04:18) We can see that and uh name collisions are actually removed from here and also packages are providing a structure to the code that suppose similar type of behavior you want to incorporate in one package so you can uh use package for segregation of the code like based on the hierarchy we can uh segregate the code like yeah okay so okay so what happen if two packages have the same class name if they have same class name then uh like uh we can access them with the help of like package.
(04:52) class name uh so the compiler will understand this class is from this package like that so we have to uh we have to like import uh like import then provide particular package dot then whatever class you want or do star it will import entire package like that we can solve this issue okay okay okay so are you aware of the static keyword in Java yes yes so static keyword is associated with the class not with the instance of the class uh whenever any uh variable is declared as static then that variable uh memory is allocated only
(05:28) once um and what whatever changes happens it happens only in the same particular memory no different object is created or yeah that is what static is okay so they might have static uh block there might have static methods right so can a static block throw an exception static block yeah if uh static block is basically used for uh performing operations only on static members so yeah I think so it can through exception if uh non-static data is incorporated okay okay yeah it can throw exception so can you override static
(06:12) methods uh in Java can we override yes we can override okay uh are you sure so I think we cannot override it is not related to instance so yeah I was thinking like static is related to only class so it is it has nothing to do with the instance of the class we over it only when we want to incorporate that method through object of the class so I guess it's it's not possible yeah yeah it's not okay so uh let's say uh we we have a class with both static and non-static methods uh so can you explain the execution flow when
(06:58) the class is loaded like what happen first okay so when the class is loaded in memory so all the static methods will be uh at the same time loaded because static is along with the class only and uh yeah so first they will be invoked so without creating object of the class we can execute the static method that is the beauty of that and uh after that so whatever operation is written inside the static method that will be performed and post then whenever the object is um created by the Constructor of the class and time the methods uh which are called
(07:32) by the object those will get function means like those will get invoked okay uh okay so uh do you know about uh generics generics generic classes yeah uh not exactly like I just am aware of the optional class which is the generic class which uses like type of that inside like yeah the less than greater than brackets we use that like those are like generic classes uh okay okay so but you are not 100% sure like what this is and like how yes can okay so can we use generics with arrays generical arrays yeah maybe okay not sure
(08:27) right okay I've noted in with generic so that's right okay okay so you but you must I mean you have worked on exception handling right yes yes exception so what what happens when an exception is thrown in a static initialization block static initialization like the static block uh so basically static block will get executed before the main method uh and if exception is thrown in that case then uh yeah like you have to handle that that exception okay so actually uh when we throw an exception in a static block so
(09:07) it's not got within that block it will cause a runtime error and the class loading will fail so you will see some exception like exception in initialize eror something like that okay that type of exception okay yeah so can we throw an exception from finally block we have like try catch and finally can we throw an exception from finally block uh I don't think so uh because final is used to uh close a resource to the closing operations uh and it is executed in spite uh despite the exception occurs or not occurs
(09:45) so if exit method is then it will terminate I don't think we can throw exception you are saying like uh I mean as per your uh you are saying like we cannot I mean exception cannot be from the final blog right because it doesn't make any sense I think so okay but the correct answer is uh we can throw an exception from a finally block uh okay oh then we'll have to write code to handle that exception like catch that exception again so the the exception from the finally block will surpress the original
(10:25) exception which can yeah which further can lead to like uh lost debugging information I mean that is not a good practice uh that lead us some unnecessary problems but yes we can throw an exception from finally blog okay yeah so do you know about custom exceptions and inbuilt exceptions yeah custom means like whenever we want to create a custom message yeah which are better cust custom exceptions or like buil-in exceptions I mean which prefer prefer is uh we can prefer custom exception because we can uh let in uh we can let
(11:08) the client know in our own language which the client also understands easily so I feel it's much good practice to in incorporate custom exceptions okay okay so can you name uh any inbuilt exception can you give a name in built like arithmetic exception is there array index out of bound exception then null pointer exception class not found exception uh yeah these are in built okay okay so you also know about overloading right method overloading yeah yeah can method overloading be determined at one time can we determine
(11:54) the method overloading at R time no basically overloading means uh same meth third name with different return type and different arguments so this is a compile time polymorphism uh run time is overing is okay yeah okay so we cannot determine this at compile time oh sorry run time run time yeah it's a compile time colorism okay so how does Java resolve a call to an overloaded method overloaded method with the help of the uh return type of that particular method and the type and number of arguments that we are passing inside the
(12:33) method so that's how it will uh get to know that okay which method is called at uh yeah at compil okay have have you used final keyword in your project ever final uh not in Project basically like maybe very few exceptions where we want to maintain the same data uh same data of that employee throughout uh we have used final key can you tell me a use case like uh like a real uh world use case or real time use case any real time application like suppose like employee IDs we are uh making employee management system so we
(13:18) are saving the DAT of employe so the ID of employee will suppose once the ID is entered in the system then it will remain unique and it will remain uh unchanged throughout this application like throughout that employees inside the system so we can make employee ideas final so that it will not be modified later and that is how the EMP be distinguished okay but uh okay so okay okay so can we modify a final object uh reference modify a reference of let's say we have created a final object so can we change I mean we are not
(13:56) interested to change its values and all we areed to change it reference so can we do that as far as reference is concerned um so you understood like what I'm trying to ask reference the reference variable of the object not the object itself but yeah yeah yes yes y uh reference variable we can change uh yes I don't know I'm not sure we can do that because if we declare anything as final then the value of that variable inside memory will remain same reference can point to that memory yeah multiple reference can point
(14:45) to the same memory location having that value okay maybe I not sure maybe okay so we cannot change the reference of a final object once it has been assigned okay so we yeah yeah okay so but we can I mean still modify the objects internal state if it is mutable but I mean the end we cannot change references okay okay so what's the impact of declaring a method as Final on inheritance do you know yes uh if we declare a method final then uh this method cannot be overridden inside the child classes so it's stops
(15:29) The Inheritance like it prevents the overriding of okay okay nice uh okay so moving to some different [Music] questions but do you know about uh inner classes in Java I have uh read about it long back about it okay okay no problem uh okay so uh you know about Java memory model memory model um related to something called threads concept maybe not sure okay and garbage collection yeah garbage collection yes uh it's like automatically it will deallocate the memory for the objects which are no longer in reference which
(16:27) are not no longer in use it will deallocate memory so that this memory can be utilized for those objects which are needed by us okay okay so uh okay so how would you investigate and fix a memory leak in Java what's a step you would take how to investigate memory leak yeah uh if it call U GC method like system.
(16:57) GC method uh it will automatically uh freeze the memory okay memory noes uh moving to some uh next questions [Music] so uh do you know about design patterns design patterns yes I'm aware of them yeah like Okay so uh have you created a single ton before yeah single ton yes like one class with one object itself okay so how can we create uh can you tell me some steps uh like Singleton class basically simply the uh like if we create a class and then we just instantiate a class with single object so yeah it is a single
(17:54) pattern of design class okay okay yeah so uh now moving to some uh different section so can you tell me like uh uh what are the advantages of using spring boot over traditional spring application yeah so like spring boot uh it uh autoc configures many dependencies for us uh where we don't have to sit and uh uh care about the uh versions and everything so whatever dependenc be mentioned in the form XML file project object model file it will uh give us in the meanwhile and so the dependencies basically are uh configured
(18:36) automatically in spring board uh unlike in Spring we have to manually go and make the dependency like versions We have to uh sit and configure everything then it also spring Bo provides us with the servers embedded servers like tomat and jetp and spring we have to configure explicitly the servers then uh um so okay what's the default server default server is stat by Spring can we change it yes we can change it with the help of uh like we have to just mention in for.
(19:13) xml we have to mention uh starter dependency you have to change it to starter uh hyph undertow or starter hyph jety then that from that it will pick okay this server is operated I have done that okay and what's Auto auto configuration Auto configurations uh like uh the if we require any particular object at run time so the spring boot we can we have annotations to Define uh which will make the spring boot aware that okay these are the classes which we can make the object at run time and we can Auto wire them at the run time okay so how does the spring boot decide what to
(19:48) configure automatically internally internally uh like through the annotations uh it understands like suppose adate configuration classes here so whatever beans we inside the adate configuration uh it will prepare the P like it will prepare those instances at run time and also component scan is there at bit component is there so all those classes having these annotations springboard is aware that okay I will prepare the object of these classes at run time so that is how it understands and uh with the help of Constructor uh
(20:18) dependency injection and set dependency injection it will inject that particular objects inside the uh classes so we don't have to manually go and uh like uh write that so it's a very smart so basically yeah yeah okay so we have class path right uh so most of the time spring boot looks into that and we have char so it decides after looking into that like what to configure and what all like right yeah okay okay so uh can you give him uh give an example of a situation where uh we would need to override the default a
(21:00) configuration example where we have to override yeah suppose Auto configurations um suppose if we want to implement uh some new functionality or add something modify according to our requirements then we will try to override that or if you want to break some violation suppose I can give an example like if we uh if you're using Singleton class and you're cloning that particular object of Singleton class so this actually breaks the functionality of single turn classes that where only one can exist so in
(21:34) order to prevent uh uh like prevent the breaking of single turn pattern through cloning of object what we can do is that we can override the Clone method in that class according to like whatever is the need and that's how it will prevent the uh prevent from violating the certain rules of uh design patterns so I guess we can override it according to whatever we want so this one example I sh so same Auto question also we can override according to whatever we want okay so can you tell me the steps to integrate the database in Spring boot
(22:10) application like yeah first of all yeah so uh so first of all we will uh create a class uh inside the reposit package and we will uh annotate it with the help of adate repository so it will uh make aware the spring Bo that okay these are the reposit data access object classes where repository is coming into the picture and U so that repository class will extend the JP repository which internally calls adate repository uh annotation and adate transaction annotation so we don't have to go and um write adate transaction every time
(22:44) because adate whenever the class extends JP repository it will internally call the add transaction and maintain the transaction State uh so yeah this one thing and second thing is that uh in the class uh uh in in another class what we will do is that the entity package in that entity package we will create the entity class we will annate with the help of added entity and atate table uh to denote that this is a table uh giving it name and at theate column for the columns and at theate ID for primary key with uh generation like Auto auto
(23:19) generation we can do that for random generation of uh primary key values okay and yes these are the steps we will take for uh JP set of configuration and uh yeah okay okay so how how can you how how would you secure a springboard application secure MH yes uh I have heard like not Incorporated in the project but I have heard about the J like Jason uh okay token uh a feature to secure so you have heard uh like these authorization these tokens and all but you haven't worked on this before right okay but uh when if you get some
(24:13) new project and if you are asked to implement it from scratch then how will you do I mean will you learn before or uh like you already know how to implement this uh just curious to know actually uh I just like I'm just uh gaining knowledge more on this part so okay yeah I'll make a project on my end first of all to get En Hands-On knowledge and then yeah because uh when when when you'll switch or when you will go into the different project so I think this is the first step they will ask like how would you secure and all the
(24:52) things okay yeah so Implement on uh and add in your GitHub so that's fine so whenever in future when you need these type of things so you can take reference okay yeah sure sure sure okay so can you tell me what but you you haven't implemented I can understand but do you know the uh I mean I theoretical knowledge like what is Spring Security Spring Security is basically for uh making uh security configuration so that only certain profiles like through authorization only certain profiles can be able to uh access certain modules so
(25:32) that is authorization where profiles come into the picture and authentication side I guess uh and so what are this authentication and authorization what's the difference between these authentication and authorization yeah basically authorization means like who can see what that is authorization which profile can see what so admin will be able to see only that part and as an employee will able to see only that so that is authorization and uh like everything is not visible to for for everyone that is authorization
(26:03) and authentication means um like uh um this next part of it like authenticate a user based on the user ID password suppose we are putting so like if the password is correct we can authenticate like that maybe okay got it so uh do you know the method level security like how can we secure any methods in a class what we so we have some annotations like pre-authorized post authorized secured enable global method security these are some annotations so we can use these annotations in Secure method annotation okay okay so moving to some different
(26:57) questions one second okay so so what's the role of idit server in Spring boot application a role of it server embedded server embedded server okay so embedded server like it is a default server on which the springboard application will run and host the application so suppose we write in the postman that particular URL that will that will be through that embedded server only it will host the uh yeah okay so uh can you deploy a spring boot application as a traditional War file to an external server yes we can with the help of
(27:49) certain commands are there for war to convert that into war file also I guess uh if you want to make project in the form of War then through that spring starters. that website we can select war and then continue the project okay okay uh okay so uh how spring boot handles application configuration application configuration okay with the help of um like adate configuration classes annotations only basically and dependence and uh it will take properties from applicational property file and so what's the order of Precedence uh
(28:42) in the configuration do you know of Precedence first uh like first of all the main method if you locate a class having the main method I'm asking for configurations like what's the order of Precedence I mean we have some different ways to add configurations right like environment variables external configuration files command line argument so what's what's their precedence I guess first maybe uh inside the classes that would be given the first preference second would be from the resource files maybe third from the
(29:22) command arguments okay so first is command line arguments then environment variables and external configuration files okay okay yeah so uh in your current project how the how these uh configuration files are structured uh I'm asking uh like we have uh Dev configuration file non production environment configuration file something like that okay so like basically I'm not that much aware because because I'm into the support currently but uh okay through the backend yeah not that much okay so when you push when you push your code
(30:07) okay so you must add some configuration files application EML or properties file right so uh is that Dev environment or what I mean do you know about environments yeah like basically different environments for deploying in production pre- and lower level and higher level environments okay so uh let's say if I if I uh give you some project okay or uh I mean pre-build a project so and if I ask you to optimize this project so what steps would you take optimize in a sense suppose if you want uh to minimize the Cod so we can
(30:59) remove all those things where uh we don't want The Unwanted uh methods return with help of optimize means uh we can decrease the dealing while calling apis while running applications like fetching results yeah yeah fetching result with respect to time I'm asking like how can we uh if make our application more and more efficient I mean what steps we we can use okay [Music] EP okay so let's say let's say if somewhere uh we are searching any element in o n square right so we can reduce it to O Lan this is how this is
(31:50) the I mean first thing we can look up into the loops like Loops yeah we can avoid avoid multiple loops and we can let's say let's say one method is calling two different methods okay and in the two different methods we have uh same DB queries so instead of writing the DB queries in those two methods we can implement it one parent method correct correct we can use stream API right so these are so use we can use some lthms yeah then we can use uh that implenting yeah yeah yeah okay okay though [Music] now do you know about spring boot
(32:45) actuator actuator yes basically uh this is one dependency if we have to add in P Ro XML file uh what this does is that it will provide us the health of the application it is like runtime uh production it it makes the application of production ready application by giving us the health metrics uh like how much it is uh weak or strong based on the servers strength and all yeah strength of the application okay so can you uh name some end points provided by the spring boot actuator end points um uh like we have health info battery
(33:29) Matrix yeah like I'm not that much uh clear but uh can customize and yeah yes we can customize okay okay uh threads how many threads are running at the same time we can get that okay so uh I mean uh do you test spring boot application as well uh like by writing un unit test cases in your project or not no no okay uh but you can write right if someone give you to write yeah yes by so do you know uh some about some invitations by before writing uh the junit test cases um not currently I'm not uh stepped into that okay okay but
(34:28) that we can write test cases for that using Mo and all test cases okay and uh do you do you know about the spring boot starters and how do they work spring Bo STS yes yeah please tell so starter dependencies like a starter uh web we have for the web applications like restful it will create it will help us in making restful web applications if we write start a web then there is starter jpa for jpa configurations in the entity side like repository side then starter data jpa then starter data hibernate for including hibernate uh in
(35:14) our code and uh web uh jpa and I have used these three uh till now okay and also yeah I've changed the server from uh Tomcat to on through yeah start got it got it yeah okay so yeah it's done from my side uh laki so it was nice and uh yeah you have some great knowledge but uh I think in terms of practical knowledge uh you can work on that area because you have four years of experience right if you if you will switch into some other company so they'll ask you like uh what you have worked like the basically I
(36:05) have two years of uh experience into development and two years of experience into Java backend support so basically like currently I'm not not not into the development site so if I get projects I definitely like Leverage my skills in development as well and you can do one uh thing like you can create some mini projects uh like on Spring Security on testing do three stuffs which are important for development and add those in your kidl so whenever in future if someone give you task so you can just take reference okay and now talking
(36:39) about your Java skills so it's also good I'll give you out of 10 very less questions you were lacking but in most of the questions you give answers very
