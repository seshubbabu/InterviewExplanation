Transcript:
(00:00) so hey guys today we have Z KH and he's having almost four years of experience in Java and spring so hey hi Z how are you I'm good fan how are you I'm also good so is my voice clear to you yes okay okay shall we start yes fan yeah can you please introduce yourself hi everyone so my name is zahid I have four years of experience I have worked with spring and Java particularly and I have worked over a lot of projects during my four years of experience so can you please tell me your recent project uh you have working
(00:40) so uh my recent project was working on the HR System where we were providing the facilities for the use clients uh and it was like entirely about the HR systems payrolls uh hirings terminations dealing with all that okay okay so it's based on Java and springbot right yeah okay so which Java version uh I we are currently using Java 17 oh nice so can you please tell me like what are the new changes added in Java 17 that's so the latest features that are added are uh records records are there parameters
(01:26) or pattern matching is there like before uh uh we used to have uh if we used to check if some instance is of some different class then we had to create a variable of that and then we can use that now everything is like we can do better matching a lot better okay records uh yeah okay okay yeah and which spring boot version uh three okay and what's the latest spring boot version that's going on uh 3.0.
(02:01) 3 something similar okay so uh what's the process that you need to follow to run a spring boot application can you please so uh so we need to go to the spring initializer have our dependencies whatever we want and once we have that clean build if we are using the me then we have to choose which build system we are we have to use whether grad or M and accordingly we can proceed forward this Gradle clean build or even clean install and so on yeah okay so what are the specific configuration settings required for a spring boot application as such there is no specific
(02:40) but we can specify the Port Port is the one and uh we need to configure like in the P file Tomcat is needed basically server is needed yeah any any dependency uh other than this uh there no I don't think there is anything else nether okay okay so how how you manage different profiles and environments uh so and your project uh so we create different profile profiles so based on different environments we can run them uh in the spring profiles we can create a profile like profile Dash then the profile like local we are using local
(03:23) abroad and Dev different profiles and based on the property uh it takes precedence over the property specified or in the properties file main property files okay uh okay so uh like internally how does spring boot handle dependency management how does uh spring internally so okay so basically whatever is available on the class PA like dependencies those are autoconfigured and we can disable them uh so this is like overall ccept how it is basically uh like whatever is on the class path it checks that uh if it's reachable it
(04:09) creates the instances like beans of that which are autoconfigured for us okay so you are familiar with G or MAV uh I am familiar with both of them but uh MAV currently I'm using okay so in m so I think parent form uh yes so spring boot handles I use this parent form initially MH then yeah just provides a set of manage dependencies that we can use in that application correct yeah okay we can also check using the M inde dependency tree yeah and now uh how do you uh integrate Spring Security so if we have to use we have to firstly
(05:04) I usually go to the spring initializer again take the security jar from that string security and add in the MAV pal file and once I have that I go to I create a class that extends uh web security configure and then again depends which uh what exactly I want if I want authorization or authentication uh basically the concept is that rol then add matches and different things okay okay so uh can you can we use spring boot uh I mean spring boot application which are not using spring uh can we use spring batch application which is not using the
(05:48) spring internally um yes we can use that like we have a basic jar can you come again your question again like can can we use spring r with applications which are not using spring yeah and by that do you mean to inject the dependencies in the project uh no I mean integrating some other application uh in the spring boot project which are not using spring framework yes we can like as long as it should be a jar file then like uh any file which is a jar file we can integrate that it is not necessarily needed that it should be okay so you
(06:33) mean we can add JN file correct let's say It's Made in Wango or any other thing right correct okay so are there any performance implications when adding spring rout to an existing I mean to other on Spring application is there any I don't think because it's dynamically getting loaded so there is no as such performance impact okay compile time may be a slightly longer but run time won't okay so maybe something happens due to Auto configuration feature some performance overhead sorry can you come again uh
(07:18) like I'm saying uh maybe there is a performance overhead due to it's Auto configuration features I been like sign so uh I'm not certain about that but I think compilation may be slightly longer but runtime shouldn't be an issue okay okay yeah no problem so moving ahead can you please explain rest controller rotation so rest controller annotation so basically there are two annotation one is controller the second one is rest and controller so rest controller basically specifies whatever is in the response that we are sending
(07:58) it is uh like it's it's a payload Json payload that's going forward so we can also specify in the risk controller what exactly it's not necessary that we have to return the Json but we can produce in the we can specify in the parameters the risk uh on the risk controller produces and then we can specify different things like application Json or XML so XML will be post forward to the end point okay and the conversion is done by the spring itself okay yeah nice so what are some common practices for returning different HTTP
(08:35) status code from a rest controller so 22xx deals with the state schools like okay created updated and so on 300 usually deals with the redirects 400 deals with the service request like user is not authenticated if uh user is not authorized it is 403 if user is not authenticated it's 401 and 4004 uh 44 service not require not found like we are access trying to access something that does not exist on the server 500 deals from the server side if something goes wrong from the server side if something is wrong with the client side
(09:12) yeah it's 400 server side is 500 okay so uh like uh what would you uh return the status code if uh in a delete API and successfully deleted uh for successfully deleted I think to uh I think 208 I'm not certain but 208 deals with 200 not able to recall and as you recently said like we can add XML right I mean we can return XML instead of Json and the rest API can we return some custom uh formats yes we can uh return there are like it again depends but I have dealt with these two Json and XML there are
(10:00) provision for others to also return it the conversion is basically then we have to take our take over how we want the conversions so how how you return the custom for uh I think in the producers uh we have to basically when we have to return a response it is the dispatcher Sil is the main uh in the overall framework which is responsible for convergence so I think some component is needed to override right and the converion logic needs to be there okay okay and yeah moving ahead so what are ided server available so ided servers there are two
(10:44) ambed servers if we are using the uh spring MVC then Tomcat is the default one and if we are using the uh reactor framework spring reactor then we JT is there okay so how does spr decide which MB server to use if multiple options are available uh so in the Palm uh yeah like uh uh so by default it is built in if MVC we are using then it is uh Tomcat if we are reactor we are using then it's JY by default but again uh the maven Works what whichever dependency is found on the palm it overrides what is in the
(11:25) parent Palm so yeah we can override it also but it is like default is this way okay can you provide an example of some any advanced configuration for one of the server so Advanced configurations um Advanced configurations so in case of reactor uh it's filters like do filters and like if we want to do the authentication JWT JWT authentication we have to do the uh on the filters but if we are using MVC uh spring Tomcat then we have to do it on the dispat Ser okay so how can you optimize the performance of an server appliation like
(12:17) what you can uh okay we can it actually depends on a lot of things so uh how can I improve the performance performance I have no idea like we have limited number of threads we can extend them maybe that is one thing that we can do uh what you said threads yeah yeah this yeah way we can specific settings uh like connection time out M okay we can also enable from operation okay anys have you work with swager uh a bit not remember I'm not able to recall it right now but I have worked with swager okay so what it does
(13:17) like why why do we use this I mean do you know so it is basically to um make it is like a documentation of our endpoints it provides us documentation like what each endpoint uh does what it expects what it Returns what is the status codus and other things so we don't have to explicitly write the comments so Swagger is there we can provide it to the front end and they can work on it so we uh like it's automated completely automated so if we are making any chains we're rerunning our rebuilding our Swagger files and
(13:52) it's like automatic getting updated okay so uh can we customize a specific Auto configuration can we uh yes we can do so uh by like overriding what's uh provided there and uh like we can add the customization for example we have data source now if we have in memory database it's already there but if we want to do some other customization we can make a class adding configuration and be using the data source and injecting that one and do further more thanks okay yeah so how would you design transactional
(14:34) method that involves calling multiple databases and a message um how would I uh configure it sorry can you come again how would you design transactional method that involves multiple databases and message that involves okay so firstly I will split My Method into different uh like uh I would add the transaction wherever I'm calling only one end point I'm calling I'm doing one thing so if something fails it should not put my database in inconsistent state so I will not put it like on two different database but rather on one database and
(15:15) one table and I will try to like uh to go more granular uh in the details where I will try to make transaction avoid transaction where I can in short so where it's actually needed I will put it there so read calls I will not try to put in transaction write calls I will try to put in transaction okay uh so you are saying something similar like distributed you would get distrib transaction pattern uh yeah sort of I have not worked with the with this design pattern but yeah sort of so uh I me have you worked on
(16:04) Hy yes I have worked on the GPU hibernate also I'm fa but JP I have handon experience so do you know the N plus one select problem uh yes so we are trying to for example uh do something and as a result there is n plus one quir is getting generated for that one simple thing uh for example one of the cases where I found this was I was using a list uh and I was trying to delete something but this list has like uh it maintains the order so somehow the GP was resulting in N plus1 queries so it was trying to maintain like moving all the elements to
(16:52) left okay uh so uh like do you know about Json serialization DC yes can custe this yes we can customize it like Jackson is the default one that is provided but we can override it so uh we can have our own customization but it was not usually needed okay okay so have you work on webx or yes can you even over uh so in the in case of the Tomcat ambed servers we have limited number of threads in Tomcat it's by default 200 threads but when we're doing some IO intensive operations we have IO intensive application so we run
(17:43) very short like in short span of time all the threads so there is like another thing that's a project reactor that comes so it introduce the event Loop so whenever we are making a request it goes in the event and it Loops like loops around so we have like limited number of we have only 30 or 40 threats but it's like maintaining it in a optimized way we don't exhaust threads okay okay yeah so how do you optimize Performance in Spring boot application when there is a high traffic when there's a high uh okay when
(18:22) there's a high interrupt how would I firstly I will go to the is there are two things ESP I have to take consideration is it a CPU intensive or IO intensive application if it a CPU intensive then there is no way we can just scale it up on the infrastructure level rather than doing the optimization on the code level but if it's IO operation if it is iio intensive then we can firstly go to the netti and specify or like some caches we can put it and there are lot of optimizations it varies from Project to
(18:57) project but these are overall okay so uh let's say you found uh there is a your application is slower in production environment than in environment like what step you my application is slower on the production than on on the okay on the dev enironment one of the things that I can easily figure it out is that load it's uh like the load is very high of the dat databases and then it's in the local environment so there is something with the transactions uh so I can add the first indexing on my databases that way I can check the
(19:41) performance if it's not then I can go to the database ring uh and also I can install uh like visual VM so I can see what's going on uh on my Heap and uh uh perm space perm space meta space or like how the memory is actually how much garbage collecting is getting used and how frequently it's getting used okay yeah so like do you have knowledge on some Javas architecture things like jvm jdk yes so can you pleas tell me the difference between jbm J jdk so the jdk is the first AEP big circle one can think of it contains the
(20:33) JRE jdk and jvm so it contains all the three things so you can construct your programs you can run them you can you have everything now J has the virtual machine inside and it can only run your program it does not have that jdk part classes and other things and virtual machine is responsible for running your Java code it's not specifically to the any bite code it can run whether it's chash or any Java it can run that and virtual machine is machine independent and right yeah okay so can a Java application be run without installing
(21:13) the J uh no it cannot so uh why uh because it needs the runtime it needs uh those classes it needs a java. lang package which the virtual machine does not have so J provides that uh jar okay so is it possible to have the jdk installed without J jdk install without JRE I think they are they can be jdk uh jdk without J uh I think jdk has the J but I'm not sure but it can it's possible to install like separately them Jr is completely different than jdk yeah it's possible okay so can you please tell me like what tools are included in the jdk
(22:04) and that are not part of the J what sorry what goals uh what goals uh did you uh is my voice clear yes uh so goals which goals are included in the jdk but not in the J is that the question yeah yes goal so goal of jdk is to just not I mean tools not okay okay okay got it so the tools that are available in the jdk are I think jell is provided and also um uh Java compiler is provided there uh before Java 21 uh Java compiler was needed but after Java 21 this is no longer needed and it's inbu in the Java okay in the J Java is there runtime is
(23:00) only there okay so what are the memory storage is available in the JV so the in the jvm we have uh I think four storage one is Method area heat stack and na to memory okay so do you know about Young Generation and old generation spaces so in the like Java is autom automatically it it manage the memory for us for the programmers so we have we have to manage the memory so periodically garbage collector has to come and clean the memory so we have somehow to clean this memory periodically what we have done we have
(23:44) just classified it in two categories and we have come with a flos speed the newer objects gets deleted very fast and older objects stay for longer so we divide the main memory into two parts old generation and Young Generation and in the Young Young Generation objects are created and delet it's very fast okay uh do you know about threads yeah can we uh start thread twice can we know so a thread has a life cycle it can start then it can pause uh uh I think a wait waiting State then it goes to the termination State end State
(24:25) basically so it cannot be started again okay so uh like can you please tell me internal working of H and how was different before the Java uh whenever we have some object we try to Hash we firstly hash it so based on the hash we put it in the bucket and uh each entry in the bucket contains four things one is hash the second is the key the fourth one is the value and the fourth one is the next address so we have seen uh in Java 7 and before then preor to java8 that when we have lot of collisions we end up in a linear time so
(25:15) in order to solve that we have uh we have uh come up with the idea that whenever there there are a lot of collision we will rather than using the link linked list we will use the balanced trees for example black red red black tree okay yeah so this is only difference okay so previously it was a link list and now now it's yeah balance tree basically yeah okay and what were what was there complexities so pror prior to Java 8 in the link list we have big of n now it's big of log n on in term of collisions but other than that it is for insertion
(26:02) and deletion it's uh pig off one okay so can we print something sound conso without main method uh um before Java 1.8 it was possible using a static method but now it's not onwards to Java 8 it's not possible okay okay [Music] so like can you please tell me the use case of AR linked and head so Aries is basically needed when we uh we have we want uh like we have higher access order and we have lower deletions so link list we want when we have higher insertions and deltion but access order does not matter and haset
(27:01) we need when we have large access orders and like it's uh it provides all the three things actually insertion deletion and this nice and uh I think this theory part is done now I'll give you some uh or two coding question do you have uh ID yes yeah can you please share your screen yes sure so you are given an array and that contains only one and zero okay so like how your task is to shift the zero into the left side and one to the right side so uh okay so we have something one Z and something similar
(28:25) right and we have to move uh like ones to the left and zeros to right right yes yes okay we can do streams and we can do collectors collect collectors. partion by then we can do values then we can do black map uh can do collectors start stream and we
(29:44) can um collect S I think it should work yeah nice yeah so one more question uh you are given in sorted AR okay and you have to uh remove the duplicate elements in from the array and have to just modify the and return the uh so we have given a sorted array and which contains numbers uhhuh 0 one one two three okay you have to mody the same array and remove the duplicate elements uh okay so I can use two pointers here in this case um integer
(30:49) group or I and Jal to zal to one this one just get it was equals to J I can continue but I [Music] can CH will increment every time
(32:11) I this list sh list so if I have a zero and one they are not equal so I = to J no two pointers I need but but logic is
(33:30) not correct think here it's needed wide readys kit ch j++
(34:33) so 2 no set okay I g++ I think it should work one test it is not correct solution let me see 1 2 three reme yeah so just tell your like trying to and approach just tell your tell your approach so I will use a two pointers uh I will put put my first pointer here and next pointer also here so I will go to here next iteration I will assign
(35:37) this variable to it okay uh like 0 to zero and next time I will go to one I will check if uh I have basically compared two variables this and this I and J so these are yeah then I will I will not assign but if the these are like equal pick one and one I have to go to forward then and assign uh this by this so you are very close to the solution but no worry it's fine somewhere in the conditions yeah so yeah now moving to the next question you are given an array okay that contains uh that may contain any element from zero
(36:27) to any number okay and your task is to shift all the zero to the right side mhm and uh other elements remaining elements in the right side sorry left side zeros in the right side and all remaining elements in the left side I can also use the streams the first one solution here uh without stream uh okay streams I can all this two pointers also will be needed um I can use another array uh okay at list for teer Loop equals zero Loop is less than arist do size let r.
(37:33) set loop and I set create a variable here integer i = z let. get I so here I can do one zero okay zero why is this. get loop. equals z
(38:36) loop so um let's SP items uh so I have moved my elements okay one 1 one 2 3 while my elements not equ Z okay just tell me your I will also use two pointers here and I will assign uh on my left on my left pointer the right pointer like this case one I
(39:40) will like assign this pointer to itself and like this is zero so I will move it to here then on next iteration I will move okay I have not sped actually this so I will swap them I will swap them 0 to 1 then on this iteration 0 to one and on this iteration I will move it to here and on this iteration I will move it to the last location I think two poin yeah I have forgotten in this approach so yeah right it's done from my side amazing thanks for having me
