Transcript:
(00:00) so hey guys today we have karik imman and he is having almost five years of experience in Java spring Boot and microservices so hey hi karik how are you I'm good thanks for asking how are you yeah I'm also good shall we start yes we can start okay so can you please introduce yourself and your recent project in brief yeah I'm Kik Mani I have a I'm a Java backend developer I have nearly 5 years of experience in jav back end plsql SQL and Java features microservices spring spring boot spring ioc aop things like that would be my
(00:42) technical stack okay uh and your recent project my recent project is was with for uh with I have experience in automobile and uh Telecom applications I worked for Verizon and Ford companies in us basic companies in us okay okay so what was your role like uh to build backend system breast apis on all writing AP and writing sqls so which uh so you uh I mean which architecture monolithic or microservices microservice architecture microservice architecture so how many microservices you have in your project in your current project five years five
(01:29) microservices okay can you please name those so we have event handling we have Contra contract management we have site information and we have we have multiple schedulers which loads the data from different vendors okay and we can either Trier the schedulers manually or we can use the CR expression CR expression to make the schedu trigger at certain certain point of time during the day which keeps which tries to you get the Fitch the data multiple times if the service fails and the data that is collected from the
(02:06) vendors that based on that data we have to prepare we have to write the microservices to give the data to the front end and in the front end we will whether how the what is the vehicle performance like P charts graphs and then we have each each so if we have to add a new vehicle then we have to add all the details that facility is also aailable M okay okay yeah okay fine so moving to some question so like do you know how does garbage character work in Java yeah garbage collection when there is stack memory and have heat memory in
(02:44) the ja in Java he memory will have will have the object object that is that is created and the reference the memory address of the object is stored in the stack memory once the reference is lost in the stack memory then the object is eligible object in the Heap memory is eligible for the garbage collection okay and what's the role of finalized method in garbage collection finalized method is triggered whenever the garbage garbage collection has to be initiated we cannot forcefully run the finalized method but we can use system.gc method
(03:16) to instruct the instruct the jvm to initiate the process of garbage collection okay okay so uh can you tell me what algorithm jvm uses for garbage connection internally collection sorry I'm not sure about algorithm okay so basically jbm uses uh Mark sweep Mark compact uh generational copying so these type of algorithm internally uh to work on this garbage collection thing okay okay okay so just one quick question on this uh ET how can memory leak occurs in Java even we have automatic garbage collection Jaa uh you know like we have automatic
(04:08) uh garbage collection in Java but still uh we see some in some places like memory League happens okay so memory league in Java occur when object are no longer needed but still referenced from other reachable objects and hence preventing the garbage character from Rec reclaiming their memory so that's why yeah memory leaks occur okay no worries so Karthik uh before moving on to the next question uh do you know that we have designed a complete interview preparation package structured step by step containing 16
(04:54) PDFs I found that I know that the material is available I got when I registered me yeah let me brief on this uh it's basically a One-Stop solution to crack any interview uh this package covers four Java spring framework mavan get spring boot scenario based questions Spring Security spring MVC spring data jpa microservices hybernate General Java coding question stream API coding questions and many more the best part is that people have been telling me that they crack their interviews with this material there is a 99% chance that the
(05:27) interviewers will ask question from this package so after this uh after completing this package uh people uh I mean uh see confident in them etc etc right so post this interview I will share a link with you to get this and also I will add in the description of this video okay so now moving to our questions uh is Java 100% objectoriented programming language no it is not 100% object oriented because of the primitive data type primitive data type it has and we also have rapper classes on top of The Primitives but still we have Prim
(06:04) available in Java because of the primitive data types Java is not so because of primitive data types you said Java is not 100% objectoriented programming language right yes okay so uh can you tell me what are the advantages of java being partially object oriented Java being partially oriented partially abstracted or no no uh you said uh Java is not 100% objectoriented programming language it's partially objectoriented programming language right so yeah what uh what are the advantages of java being partially
(06:41) object oriented we can make use of the Primitive dat primitive data types which allows us for automatic memory allocation okay and we can use those primitive data types anywhere across the project okay okay yeah so basically these PR primitive data types uh runs faster and use less memory if we compare to the uh that classes objects like full integers and uh these kind of objects okay so what's the use of objectoriented programming language in the Enterprise projects by making we can create an instance of the Class by making use of
(07:25) the objects okay okay okay and do you know about uh Singleton class yeah I know about Singleton class which has a private Constructor and a priv private final variable and we have a public static method get instance method to create the instance of the to call the Constructor and create a private instance of the class okay so uh how can we create the Singleton class we can create the Singleton class by declaring The Constructor as private and we can make the we can make it thread safe also by making the get instance method as synchronized and we
(08:10) can check whether the object before creating the object we can check whether the object is null or not when the object is not the same object that was created earlier will be written every time it is called and what about finally uh uh I mean static uh I mean Ro in this Singleton class first we will make Constructor as private right yes okay next we have to create a private static instance of the class and finally we have to provide static method yes okay so are these uh Singleton classes thread safe yeah we can make the Singleton
(08:50) class thread safe by making the public static get instance method as synchronized okay by default it is not thread safe we have lazy initialization and eager initialization in lazy initialization we declare a final variable and we directly call the construct private Constructor but in case of eager initialization we check whether the instance is null or not then only the Constructor and create an instance yeah yeah yeah so Singleton you said right Singleton classes are not thread save by default if multiple threads try to create an instance at the
(09:27) same time it could result in multiple instances to prevent this we can synchronize the method that creates the instance or use a static initializer yes so yes so what is immutability mean in Java immutability means whenever the object is created that object is not allowed to be manipulated even if we want to append or prend prend the object that is created will it will check whether the object is available or available in the string constant pool in the heat memory or not if it is available it shares the same reference
(09:59) if it is not available it will create a new object and Sh the new reference of that particular object even though even in the even in the even when the shared resources are trying to access the same object the okay the object will not be will not be manipulated in the string con okay so in short uh we it cannot be changed right yes okay so why immutability objects are useful for concurrent programming when multiple threads are trying to access a shared resource there is a possibility that concurrent modification
(10:36) can can be occurred in order to prevent that we can make use of the strings are widely used in the widely used in Java so MH by making the object as as immutable object immutable the manipulation on that shared resource is not uh allowed okay so you mean uh because they can be shared between threads without needing synchronization is what you mean okay yeah so what are immutable classes string is a immutable class and we have string buffer and string Builder which are mutable string buffer isad safe string buff string Builder is not
(11:20) thread safe okay uh okay so how can we create immutable class we can we can create a customized immutable class by declaring the class as final and we can only declare the getter me getter methods inside the class but not the set of methods and every data member that is declared inside the class we can declare it as a as a final constant so so that the class immutable okay so you mean first we need to declare a class as a final so it cannot be extended right and then we have to make all the fields uh private so that direct AIS is not
(12:02) allowed and then we don't have to provide Setter methods for variables MH and then in the end in we have to initialize all the fields using a Constructor method that's how we create with imut class that's what you mean right yes that's right okay okay nice so uh yeah moving ahead what is functional interfaces yeah functional interface is introduced in the Java it can which can have only one abstract method and which can work with which is useful for creating a Lambda expression a functional interface can have any number
(12:39) of static private and default methods but it should have only one abstract method which can be useful for the useful for implementing the Lambda expression against okay okay so uh can functional interface extend another interface yes inheritance is allowed in case of functional interface when one functional interface is extending another functional interface the child interface cannot have a another cannot have another abstract method because it is the parent in abstract method is is already available and inherited to the
(13:13) child functional interface either we can over we can use the same method name and we can try to override the method but we cannot have another another abstract method but we can still have any number of static private and default methods inside the inside the Shield functional interface okay okay so uh can we create a server in Java application without creating spring or any other framework without the question can we create a server in Java application without creating spring or any other framework I mean without taking help by
(13:52) any spring framework or any other framework can we create server in Java application in Spring boot we have embedded Tomcat server inside it we can deploy and we can test our application on that server if any other server has to be configured then we have to make some configuration changes and do the and uh and have the have the another server set up like Jos or no no uh so is my voice clear yes your voice is clear okay so like my question is uh let's say uh I if if I don't want to use any spring functionality spring boot
(14:35) functionality or any other framework functionalities right I just want to work on core Java okay and how just my question is how can I create a server in core Java in Java application like without taking help of any framework spring spring W any framework by default we are able to create a we are able to write a program and run it in in core Java even without that Java itself can help execute the program okay the execution from the main method but I'm not sure whether that can be called as a server or okay so yeah yes we can create a
(15:20) server in Java application without using any these Frameworks what we can do is we can use Java SC apis uh okay so they provide some server socket class for a simple TCP server or we can use HTTP server class for HTTP servers Services okay okay uh yes so moving ahead uh as you know you have already worked on Spring boot applications so I just want to know what's the difference between rest controller and controller annotation so when we say when we annate the class with theate controller the services that inside controller is is is
(16:05) treated as a basic web service but when we the class with rest controller every will be considered the services that we write inside the the class will become restful web services okay okay so in which scenario would you preferred one over the other for data exchange when I have to create a spring boot applications where where I have to make use of the HTTP methods available and we have to integrate the application with any other with the other Frameworks like angular or react I would prefer the restful web services but when I'm trying to create a
(16:46) bundled project where where the web design is also part of the backend project by using JSP or JS in that case we can use at theate rest controller where where a web service will make sense okay okay so is it possible to combine controller and rest controller anotation functionalities in a single controller I never tried that okay so yes uh in a controller class uh you can use response body on a specific method to achieve rest controller uh Behavior Uh for example in the main class we can use Simple control anotation and on the specific method
(17:33) where we are returning Json or other data we are we can put response body so response body is nothing but a part of rest controller annotation okay yeah so how Auto configuration play an important role in Spring boot application so spring boot uh when we say at the spring spring spring boot application it is a combination of Auto configuration enable auto configuration and component scan when we say Auto say Auto configuration whenever we try to add a dependency or whenever we try to integrate a third party we want to make
(18:13) a third party dependency available in the springb project then we can add that dependency by adding the dependency either in the. XML or build. based on the build tool we are using or grel that's the specific jar files will be downloaded the external libraries where we can make where the classes and interfaces methods of that J files will be available in the spring boot application this this configuration will be done automatically in Spring boot for be for be configuration also when we when we Mark the classes as component
(18:48) service that bean will be added to the ioc container which will be either or the or the application context the will be available for Auto wiring this uh this is this is where the auto configuration is done is done in the spring boot but back in the spring we have to make few changes in the web.xml or spring.
(19:14) xml file for creation of the be okay that is done automatically spring boot okay okay all right so can we customize a specific uh Auto configuration spring boot yes we can customize uh how uh you know no I don't so yes we can customize specific aut configuration spring boot so basically it allows overriding particular aspects of its Auto configuration through properties in the application.
(20:00) properties or file annot with with annotations like configuration Properties or by defining our own Bean method that provides specific configuration so if a spring boot detects a custom Bean or property it will use that instead of default autoc configuration Bean so this flexibility enables us to uh like twak the autoc configured beans to suit our needs and providing a quick and convenient way so that's how we can customize Auto configuration okay so uh now we understood like about custom aut configuration so how can you disable specific autoc configuration
(20:38) class in Spring [Music] boot uh let's say if I if we need some class to be disabled for auto configuration so how can we do that we shouldn't be be marking that specific class as component or at service in that case the bean will not be created in the ioc container and it will not be available for auto configuration [Music] okay okay so I think uh to disable specific Auto configuration classes in Spring we can exclude the attributes uh like enable configuration and all okay so have you uh I mean what's
(21:39) your deployment strategies in your current project we are using mated from Jenkins to Jenkins 2 and we use pipeline where we have to configure our branch and we can do continuous integration continuous deployment I'm making use of the genins pipeline uh and I'll be deploying my project the open which help me deploy the project open and so you are using which Version Control git which version which Version Control git lab or GitHub or any other okay so you have knowledge GitHub so you have knowledge on uh these uh G
(22:23) and all these things yeah I do have know okay so how how do you manage mer conflicts uh so every Sprint when when I try to when I try to after making changes when I try to P mege the changes into the development branch which will be a master Branch there will be other changes made by the other developers in the team I when I do when I after pulling the pulling the pulling the mar Branch into the local environment we say when we say get merge the conflict will be occurring I usually resolve M complex manually or sometimes
(23:02) I'll have to connect with other developers to understand what changes they made in the current screen okay so have you used ttoys git no I did not okay okay access from my terminal or we can use get B okay uh can you explain the rebase process and its advantages over G in G uh okay so basically reasing in git is a process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit uh it's it's like telling a story in a more linear and clean Way by rebasing uh we can update our feature Branch with the latest from the main
(23:58) branch with without creating additional merge commits this keeps the project history neater and more straightforward making it easier to understand the progression of changes and the advantages of merging is that it results in a cleaner more linear project history which simplifies troubleshooting and cod review by avoiding the Clutter of merge commits okay so uh like which editor uh you use uh for your current project I'm using intell intellig and uh you are you must be using M yes MAV okay okay so how can we
(24:40) optimize a maven build for a large project okay so have you heard about dockerization like we can do something yeah do related and kubernetes is foration we create an of the project by making use of the docker file available in the project it creates an image the image will be into put in container can be created on top of the image and we can we can deploy the container where it will have everything one image okay each image will have a signature so it will be okay okay useful useful for multiple deployments I mean
(25:31) we can have multiple instances of the project by using the containerization okay so uh you know about mayavan life cycle and its phases I don't know the life cycle but I know how it is used as a build tool okay so what's uh what's the difference between MAV clean and MAV install MAV clean M install install makes compiles the P XML file and make sure all the dependencies are reinstalled and clean is we if we have the current previous instances running then we can to avoid that to avoid that uh impact on the
(26:29) current instance we have to do a m clean before we do the we build the project okay uh okay and uh now moving back to our G things so what's the difference between git clone git pull and git fetch git clone is for the if the repository is not available in the local we cloning it if we are if we want to make it in the available in the local environment for the first time then we can use G clone when we after cloning after cloning the project if we want to if we want to make sure that we have the we have the most recent version of the
(27:16) repository available from the remote repository then have to do a do fetch okay and what is the other one uh get get patch yeah okay so basically get F downloads remote changes without merging them into the local reposit okay no worries so like do you know how what all servers are there in the spring boot application like what all services are provided by Spring boot appliation like one is Tom Cat right and yeah can you name some other servers which are available in the string boot application but are not default one because the
(28:10) tomat is a default one Tomcat is default B server in the spring board but we can configure other servers like uh uh like Jos and JT yeah so how uh let say if I ask you to disable the existing uh Tomcat server and enable the new uh server so how how would you do that I think I'm not 100% sure we have to make some configuration changes to make the in which file in the in the build file okay we have to add the dependency we have to exclude the Tom some changes in application properties also but the address of
(29:03) [Music] that of the server okay okay so let's so have you visited make my trip app ever sorry could you please repeat have you visited make my trip app on your mobile phone my make my trip I think long back I installed it wants to make a flight reservation okay so you know like what make my trip uh do like you know what make my trip uh helps to the community right yes so my voice is clear right I mean yeah your voice is clear I think something wrong with my laptop sometimes sometimes voice goes down oh okay so uh let's say
(29:59) uh you already visited make my trip app uh so uh how would you design the schema for the similar app let's say I asked you to design a schema uh for the to clone the make my trip app so what tables would you use this is the first question I think we as the flight reservations have to be changed can be changed continuously then we have to fire the fire the services we have to call the services continuously and concurrently for that for that rather than a database we might need a distributed system where we can make we
(30:45) can s the data continuously like like messaging tool like Kafka orq and the end of the day if the data has to be stored somewhere for all the reservation like for example if we have flight reservations we have to put all the flight reservations in available from there we have to F the data render the data in the based on the based on the SE we have to provide the provide the pro bring the results back where hashing makes more sense for searching okay so what tables basically would you use uh to create the schema
(31:25) what major tables like there is one one table reservations is one res users one would be flights one would be hotels yes and and what for the reservations that have already been made those have to be persisted persisted some in in one table and the reservations that are available to book have to be available in okay and one might be for bookings one might be for uh reviews uh payments poid packages I think these are some of the major tables that uh someone uh should wait while cloning the make my tri app or making such similar app okay yes M
(32:23) okay so which is spring boot version you are using in your current project using spring three spring what's the latest version going on in the market when I try to create an app in Spring initializer I available the reent question available is spring three I believe which is a standard ver I'm not sure if the is released out in Market okay and which Java version we're using Java Java 12 but I haven't been through the updates of all the features available in 12 but I'm good with Java okay yeah okay karik uh it's done from
(33:14) my end
