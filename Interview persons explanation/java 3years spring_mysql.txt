Transcript:
(00:00) so hey guys today we have Harish Kumar and he is having three years of experience in the field of core Java and my so let's get started hey hi Harish how are you hey hi I'm fine how about you yeah I'm also good shall we start yeah sure okay can you please introduce yourself and your recent project yeah sure uh my full name is Harish Kumar KS and I have completed my MCA in Bangalore M College under vtu university so after that I have worked in two organization first one is Morphin servers private limited and the second
(00:40) one is uh HCL Tech in um in Morphin I I able to work in backend Java back end with the help of core Java so that we are providing the solutions for the banking sector who are abroad like um Bank of Bhutan and Bank of Kum and um uh some and the company was providing solutions for the African countries like Uganda Zimbabwe like that okay uh the payment system was uh usually happening how India how how in India is happening like uh phone pay Google pay and Kaka Bank can Bank how the payment system is money transferring is happening the same
(01:23) solution was providing to those those uh countries those countries in banking system okay yeah so how how you are uh managing the data consistency and like uh since banking is a critical uh project and so how you are uh taking care the uh sensitive information and all like in terms of technology or yeah in terms of Technology tools or anything yeah how I was are you asking about like how was my day-to-day uh interactions and day-to-day activity uh no no no uh actually I just want to know like you said you are working on banking
(02:06) software right uh like in banking software uh there are lot of things uh uh I mean we can do a lot of things to uh make transaction secure right and because uh there are a lot of sensitive informations that we uh don't want to leak etc etc so in order to uh uh work on this so how you are dealing this these are things are dealing by the uh cyber security things and network network system we we do we do have the network uh uh network network team so they used to take care of all these stuffs okay and they used to maintain the secure
(02:54) data okay okay uh which Java version uh you guys are using uh I know Java 7 Java 8 Java 8 okay yeah can you tell me some new features uh that were introduced in Java it in Java it uh it has been introduced Lambda okay Lambda functions uh and functional interface okay and uh optional classes okay and um many more okay okay okay so Harish before moving on to the next question uh do you know that we have designed a complete interview preparation package structured step by step containing 16 PDFs so I just want to uh give a brief on this uh it's
(03:44) basically a onstop solution to crack any interview uh this package covers score Java spring framework MAV G spring boot scenario based question Spring Security spring MVC spring data jpa microservices hibernate General Java coding question stream API coding questions and many more the best part is that people have been telling me they crack their interviews with this material uh there's a 99% chance that interviewers will ask questions from this package uh so after this interview I'll share a link with
(04:12) you to get this and also I add in the description of this video okay sure uh so moving to our questions uh can you please tell me the difference between jdk JRE and jvm yeah jdk is nothing but Java development cas inside it is an environment it provides to the programmer to write and execute their program or application okay uh J is Java runtime environment so whenever we write the programs though J Will helps to execute those programs or applications MH jdk JRE and jvm jvm jvm is Java virtual machine okay so why do we use
(05:02) jvm jvm jvm is a package inside that jvm jvm is a machine so Java is nothing but jvm so jvm has its own classes libraries and functions methods all the things so Java is nothing but jvm so jvm will provide the interface to the user to perform any operations uh based on Java okay so how does jvm contribute to Java platform Independence okay uh platform Independence is nothing but whenever the programmer write the program so the program can be executed in multiple platforms okay so if if a if a if a programmer written a program only
(05:52) for Windows so the jvm will convert those um source code to object code so that object code or object script can be run in multiple platforms okay so that that that brings to the platform independent feature to the jvm can you explain the concept of class loads class loaders yeah class loaders in class loaders in nothing but main method uh okay I'm asking uh in the context of this jvm okay I will explain what I know uh whenever we try to run the application so that time jvm will search for the main method MH whenever jvm will search
(06:46) for the main method whenever it finds the uh main method so execution will be starts from there MH okay yeah so basically class ERS in Java responsible for dynamically loading classes into the jvm trend time yeah okay yeah okay anyways uh what's the difference between Ste uh stack and Heap memory yeah both are used for to store the memory or object so in Heap uh in Heap whenever we create the new object by using the new keyword in the Java environment so it will St will search in the Heap memory whe if it is present it
(07:33) won't store again if it is not present it will store and stack is nothing but uh stack is like a first in last out okay so whenever we put the data or object into a stack uh we can able to Fitch it uh last one will be come out first okay okay what type of data stored in stack and Heap in Java specifically object level object kind of data like in in Heap we can store strings string kind of things okay uh in a stack uh I think uh I need to brush up on that yeah yeah no issues so yeah he memory stores all the objects created in a Java
(08:32) application whereas stack memory store primitive data types method calls details and object references okay uh can I okay stack stack memory stores primitive data types me and object references whereas Heap memory stores all the objects created in our Java application okay okay yeah moving ahead uh how do you implement multithreading in Java multi by using the serialization serialization uh can you brief on this like in programmatically or in theoretically uh anyway whichever you want okay uh thread is nothing but a individual task
(09:22) perform in the processor okay so uh let's assume that we have a number of uh uh task or operations we need to perform so that time uh we will be having the thread uh uh life cycle so that it will when it will first it will be create after that it will be uh waiting stage after that it will be process so like this we have five uh uh five process will be there for a thread so like this it will be operate okay okay so how you would use multi-threading to improve performance in a data processing application ah okay let's assume that uh
(10:14) we have a process we have a processor and we have a uh 10 uh applications okay so that time uh we know that only one only one application can run in One processor okay so that time we use the concepts of weight or sleep we have multiple methods for to process the thread so that time we will we will prioritize the uh we are we priori as the threads to perform in the application perform in the process by providing the how much time it has to wait okay how much time it has to wait and how much time it has to if if if in
(11:01) case two two three applications get into a processor we can make them sleep for a couple of seconds or how much time we need M like that we can able to prioritize the uh thread multi- threading Concepts okay okay so moving ahead uh what is final keyword and why we use this in Java okay final keyword Yeah final keyword okay final keyword is we use uh we use for the purpose of the whenever the data is defined we can't able to alter okay like like we assume that if a class if we can able to make the class as final so if we make the class as
(11:52) final that is we can't able to change that means we can't able to iner it by by by help of extend keyword so if we want to make anything final if you want to make unchangeable unmodifiable we can make it uh use the concept of final keyword okay uh okay so uh can you give an example of a final class and its implications final class yeah okay final class okay let's fin class in the like uh single t uh single you are asking single ton uh what is single ton uh single ton uh single ton design pattern single turn
(12:48) pattern yeah see if you can able to make the class as Final in single turn only one instance will be created okay so we can't able to cre multiple in in instance for that particular one okay okay how does a final method uh different from a static method okay see if a method is declared as static we uh we know need to we we we don't need to create the object for that so without creating the object for that uh static method we we can able to run that directly directly we can access that method M okay yeah and what about final method
(13:39) final method if a if a method is final we can't able to inherit that method or we can able to we cannot able to modify like oh override override we can we cannot able to override that method M okay okay okay so what effect does the final keyword have when used with variables uh can you repeat the question please uh what effect does the final keyword have when used with variables oh okay okay understood see uh let's assume that we have a banking applications so that uh we are we have the member functions like account number
(14:24) account name and balance all those things so usually in banking application what we do is we make those member functions as final so that we cannot able to alter okay so because of that reason we use the yeah we cannot alter okay what are the changes to the Java platform introduced in the most recent versions that you are aware of uh like what feature has been introduced in the latest uh version of java yes okay I think Java 21 has been introduced uh [Music] um uh I am not particularly okay so I'm not asking uh
(15:10) about any particular latest version I'm saying anything like uh you it may be from java 17 from java uh 11 like any latest features which you are aware of okay yeah or 8 uh like in collection framework they have made some changes okay and also tell one more thing along with this how uh have these changes affected the way you write Java code I'm not getting okay so let's say uh previously uh uh you don't have any option class I mean I'm talking about prior to Java okay so it is it is very difficult to
(16:05) handle null pointer things right now if I ask the same question I I mean if someone asked the same question to me so I can say like uh previously I it it is very difficult to handle n pointer exception now in latest Java uh features option class is introduced so uh in my uh current code changes this optional class is very helpful it is change the way to handle the L pointer exception so this is one example did you get it yeah yeah did so any feature that change your way of writing the Java code okay in uh uh in
(16:48) java8 we can able to uh modify the objects which are contained in the collections like by using the stream functions by using the um filter filter method so that is one one very good feature added anyone anyone else I mean apart from this or we can move ahead also that's fine yeah in in Eclipse we can easily uh we can easily uh uh connection easily make the connection with the databases by we used to provide all the details but now uh there will be a particular file by using that we can able to make it okay okay okay yeah
(17:40) moving ahead uh what are the packages in Java like uh uh packages in the sense what is packager uh packages uh we uh create packages then inside packages we create classes yeah uh so I'm just interested to know about those packages like what are the packages okay just in the sense can you give me one example uh for example let's say we have a Java application or any springut application uh there is a package com do this do this do inside the package there are multiple classes like there is a controller package there
(18:25) is a service package yes so uh yeah yeah okay uh there will be a model package uh controller model services so this is a this is a terminology in Java so whenever you try to create something new let's say you are going to create a new class so in Eclipse when you trying to create something new so you will see option of package as well create package create class so I'm just uh interested to know about debt package like what is debt package I mean what's the definition of uh the package okay yeah okay
(19:07) okay packages is nothing but if you want to put particular files or particular file system in a one one folder so that time we will use that package so like okay like we can assume that we have multiple applications like one is called school one is called College one is called uh companies one is called uh different so all these things we can't able to put in a particular so that time we can create multiple packages so that after the end of every package name we can provide the name called college and a company and uh uh a school a home like
(19:49) that so we can able to differentiate the uh we can able to differentiate easily okay okay uh what are the naming Convention of the packages uh camel case camel case are you sure uh no everything will be small only small yeah everything is small only yeah this is the first naming convention there is uh one more naming Convention as well mostly in Spring boot application do you know about that another naming convention um so have you noticed in Spring boot application uh there is a package name in Reverse of domain like if there is a
(20:38) website ww. example.com then the package name would be in reverse. example yeah yeah yeah yeah I know that yeah that is also one of the naming Convention of the package no that okay uh moving ahead what are access modifiers in Java uh access modifiers are nothing but but we can access modifiers are there are four access modifiers one is public private protected and default so uh by using these four we can able to restrict our class or method to to avoid the UN unnecessary uh access to the unauthorized people or
(21:23) something okay okay okay so one question why do we use getter Setters when we can make field Publix and uh getting setting them directly see gas and sets are inbuilt functions so that we can able to see whenever we Define the uh member functions like variables so uh in getter Setters it can easily we can set the values without hard Cod it okay but we can set the values into the field as well like let's say I have a class named car and there is one field uh integer car ID okay that that is public so I can uh create an object of
(22:14) the of the class named car and directly set the field let's say I just made o1 object so o1 dot uh car ID is equal to three so I just set this field because that field is public so why cannot we do that so like without using the Setters and Getters why can't we use that by hardcoded you are asking right uh no I'm saying uh why cannot we use public Fields okay uh instead of get set so what's the use of get sets we can get the value and set the value because our field our fields are private that's why
(22:59) we set and get value from get Setters but we just we just don't want to make a get Setter instead of private field we just made them uh public field so we can access now we can access those fields directly we can change those field we can get the data uh directly because those are public field now so but what's the point of using get sets um see G sets we can able to initialize easily we can able to get and set the values easily so I can get set values from the public Fields as well without uh creating getter
(23:41) Setters yeah I don't know I how to study further study okay so let's say I have created a car or a class and there are two field car ID car name okay I made these fields Public public car ID public car name Okay I uh didn't create any getter Setters okay now I just created an object of the class uh class car okay so I let's let's name it uh C variable C so car c is equal to new car so we just created an object C so when when if I just do c do car ID is equal to 10 so car ID will be having a 10 value yes okay because that
(24:31) car ID is public field we can directly set the value so yeah that is the example so let me tell you why we use getter Setter so using getter Setters instead of public variables allows us to control how values are set and xes add value we can add validation and keep the ability to change how data is stored without affecting other parts of our program yes okay uh so can a top level class be private or protected in Java top level class can be private or protected top level top level class is nothing but object level
(25:13) class top level class means uh most parent class okay most parent no it cannot be it cannot be yeah uh because it restricts exis making it Ausable from many other classes okay uh moving ahead can you please tell me what are indexes in MySQL okay indexes indexes are used to set the values to the particular uh uh uh row indexes are mainly indexes are used to set the values okay okay so have you used indexes in your project and if yes can you okay no I hav okay and uh uh how do you create a stored procedure in my
(26:17) SQL okay like how to how do we how do we create the store procedures yes yes yes uh first we will take the access for the database by providing the uh credentials after that we will we will uh we will set the if a method is required number of the method the particular function or method will require some number of parameters so those parameters will be provide will be available in the database so we will access those parameters by providing the uh this one a stored procedure by by getting them so after that after that that whole
(27:01) object will be passed to the uh testing purpose like uh in the purpose of URL okay how can you upd data record in uh my SC database like we have some row so we need to update that row MH okay so like should I say the query or syntax um the anything which you prefer so if you want to update that particular uh uh table means so we need to provide the update keyword MH update uh after that we need to provide the table name update update student uh update okay let's think that uh we will update the marks of a arish
(27:56) in the particular uh table so update uh up update table name uh after that marks where where marks is equals to 100 or 150 or 8 80 like that okay so don't we use set sorry set correct okay okay instead of update we need to set values correct [Music] okay uh yeah that is fine so so can you share your screen and uh open any editor notepad anything I will just give you a few queries to write okay share screen yeah yeah uh like uh should I open Eclipse any anything any editor uh I will ask you to write SQL
(29:00) queries okay so open notepad++ Eclipse vs code online anything what bench we have I think okay so uh first question is one second uh write SQL query to find the second highest salary from a employees
(30:09) table highest salary yeah second highest salary what happened my camera okay let it uh I mean now not required you can just go ahead without camera second salary okay M so uh we have aggregate function called Max select T select MH Max of salary Max of salary M from from after that uh we can provide the one more query okay uh in thatle C select Max Max of uh salary from employee e m p l y e employ from
(31:20) employee soel like ma salary from uh this are from employees uh can I repeat like initially you wrote select ma s from inside bracket from employees or from this from employee okay from employee mhm yeah okay okay can you explain this uh like how this is getting okay we are uh here we are using the uh inner what is that name here we are using aggregate function after that we are using the uh what is that that inbuilt query uh there is a name I to nested query uh
(32:27) nested query no we are using your nested query okay so nested query will helps to figure out the uh run the two queries at a time so that uh select will be the keyword after that Max is the aggregate uh uh function uh salary select Max salary salary is the table name salary is the column name m after that from is the SQL keyword employee is the table name so in inside that we are providing the one more query okay one more query so that is again select Max is aggregate function after the salary is the column
(33:08) name and employe is the table name yeah I understood it uh now uh how will you write for the third highest salary okay so will you write three nexted queries no we know need to write three nested query um for that there is a something uh called okay three will be there um there is a logic is there to figure out something to calculating n cell okay uh so how do you uh Delete to duplicate record from myql table duplicate okay duplicate record duplicate record okay we
(34:14) can primary key by using the primary key for key duplicate record to delete the alter we need to use the alter keyword or we can uh join uh the same table yeah uh like employees E1 iner join employees E2 yes and we can check whether e1. email is equal to e2. email yes something like that okay yeah so yeah Harish it's done from my end
