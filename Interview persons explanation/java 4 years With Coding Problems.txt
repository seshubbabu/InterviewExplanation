Transcript:
(00:00) so hey guys today we have M Krishna he is having four years of experience in Java spring Boot and microservices so those who are having interest in the same walk interview please fill out the form below so hey hi VY how are you yeah hi fan I'm good and what about you yeah I'm also good so shall we start yeah yes sure okay okay so can you please introduce yourself yeah hi fan yeah myself Krishna Jag so I have past four years of experience in Java backend systems to develop web applications okay by using
(00:32) the Java and J2 hnet spring spring Boot and I have knowledge on the M as well okay and mainly I'm working with spring boot monolithic applications mainly I have more experience on that one and coming to the my project so I have work with client is eBay okay so in eBay we have the project name is the call Miner so it is the sub modle of that eBay applic eBay project so eBay it is a e-commerce application so in that it is a call is a sub mod of the product product so mainly what we are doing here so main objective of the call project so
(01:11) in eay they have the their customers right so if the so if the customer have any issue with any product any building any issue he need to communicate three ways they have okay so one is the email and chat and through voice calls okay another one we need to get the feedback from the client side like customer side M these are the four pipelines we have divided so mainly I worked on the two models one is the email chart transcript Emil transcript and chart transcripts okay here along with our Java development team so we have a data VAR
(01:43) team as well so the data team will provide the metadata info about the transcripts and email transcripts details so we will capture that metadata info so this info coming up in the form of CSP files comma separate separate MH for example if I can explain the chart transcript for chart pipeline so here in the chart module we we are taking one constraint like chart activity ID so whenever the customer has initiated any issue with the agent some transcrip will be generated so previously they are sto storing in the J servers now they are
(02:19) migrating to the Java application spring boot okay processing the complete CH information G server to so now we are introducing the call different so we storing the data in the call Cloud so how we processing this flow is so first we will go through that CSV files we will pick up that activity ID So based on that activity ID we will grab the chart transcript metadata info we will and then we will consume few rest call services that c has providing so we will consume their rest Services we will processing that chart information to the
(02:55) their Cloud so okay so this flow happening through email transcript and and Survey as so these are the happening and we are storing this transcript means Bas on the locals so now as of now we are introducing only three locals that is eBay Us in the UK and a us three locals we are introducing so later on we have multiple locals like multiple locations to deploy their chter transcript details to the cloud okay so you are getting CSV file you are searching finding on the base of activity ID okay yes so how how you are
(03:36) searching can you please tell me how you are getting those data through the activity ID yeah like here suppose if okay so which operation you are using I mean which are you using any DV operation or like what no like I can explain so basically we are deploying that our application that traditional approach like normal deployment comut server you deploying that application in the form of so they are providing one remote remote Mission remote server that Ser you are deploy the applications so in the same server itself the data te
(04:12) maintaining the metadata info metadata info yeah that CSP files so from that particular directory we will pick that CSV files so we are implementing few schedulers in day wise we are running the schedulers okay while while running the schedulers we will pick that we will load the all where where you wrote the commands to run the scheduler yeah where you load uh added the commands to run the scheduler I mean which file in which file of project we have to write some commands to run the automatically right yeah annotations at meth
(04:55) level okay so we also write uh this shed things at EML file properties file like H like that yes yeah in annotation levels we are declaring the the schedulers right maybe in future if you need to modify the time time stamps we need to use that configuration files like property file from the property file we will capture the details yeah we are not statically declaring the we are getting the in case which which model uh you guys follow uh on for this project like waterfall and uh agile okay aile okay so uh can you please tell
(05:36) me like what's your application deployment structure deployment structure yes yeah uh basically we are following the traditional deployment approach only so okay local Mission we are using the spring boot right so the we coming up the server so we are running along with me m application it is so we are running commands like and we are generating that file distributed particular enironment like suppose if we are okay with that Q environment we have to we need to generate according them so if we you need to get ready for the production so
(06:16) production level v file we need to generate so once we are generating the v file we we will catch the v file and then we we need to connect that from our local machine to that remote server like remote desktop machion so from there we already set up that p no no pipel no pipeline so there have tomat direct tomat installation as well so in the Tomcat directory in the web apps we will deploy the directly okay okay so you you guys use any Version Control System uh like gitlab GitHub GitHub we GitHub okay yeah so moving to some question so uh have
(07:00) you uh handled exceptions in this application yeah yeah we we hand so how do you like can you please discuss a situation where you have to handle multiple exceptions in a Java application your Java application yeah like as I mentioned so we are using the call Miner third party apis we are consuming their AP so how we are integrating their third party APS through rest template we are consuming that Rest full API what they are providing so once whenever we are using the rest template it may be chance to rise the rest C exception
(07:38) while cons yeah so in that scenario we have to maintain that risky code in Tri block so we need to handle that cash in ex exception logic in cat block okay so are you guys not added Global exception or custom exception Global ex yes we had we like can tell me the few Uh custom exception names you have added or your team or your in your project yeah like in the global exceptions we if you need to dep implement the global exceptions we extend the exception class we need to and then we have few anotations in the
(08:17) spring as well like rest controller advice as well okay that anation is taken care by and then suppose if you have any input data to while processing any you are calling any rest API any API so we need to handle property level validations we can perform okay so the these these validations we can by using we can use some default anotations as well so like at not blank at okay so how do you prioritize which exceptions to catch prioritize which exceptions okay so these are comes under spring validations spring validations and those
(08:56) exception and if you need to handle any custom except ception like yeah in the method level we need to declare exception Handler annotations is there so use that annotations okay okay so how how do you ensure uh uh how do you ensure like exceptions and law logs all these are like working properly and handed handled gracefully in your application like means like we we need to execute means how how do you ensure that exceptions are logged and handled perfectly in your [Music] application okay okay instead of declare the like stack Trace we will
(09:46) use that logs log error so in that log errors log. error we will declare we will get that message get localized message or else error message we will get and then we will display that log error message as well so then we can we can identify the logs okay okay so uh can you uh like uh moving to the different question can you tell me the difference between both uh abstract class and interfaces like scenario where you have used both abstract class in interfaces abstract classes interfaces yeah so abstract class may have only one
(10:25) abstract method okay by default method has to be abstract M go ahead and interfaces can see okay so basically uh I think uh in my project uh I use interfaces to Define operations like save update and delete eras ABS classes to provide shared logic like validation and error handling and common to document type something like that so have use S the same thing yes yeah use like we can achieve the loose coupling instead of creating the classes we can Define the interfaces we can Implement that CL implementation for the
(11:11) concrete classes yeah so uh like what was the uh relation I mean behind like what's the approach behind choosing an abstract class over interface or vice versa mean have you encountered these things before uh like which to choose Etc class or interface I think basically most of the times we are choosing with the interface reference approaches only MH butst classes deleted better again I'm not sure that one I think most of the times we are using interface reference approaches okay okay uh can you tell me about garbage
(11:52) collection in Java yeah yeah garbage collections yeah in Java we have the garbage collector so basically garbage collector is responsible for so it automatically identifying and is there any object is no longer in use M so then then that object will be fre of the memory the memory spaces and then taking care car collector yeah okay uh so like which garbage collection strategies uh did you choose and why which strategy like to prevent the memory legs MH so we need to choose that internally it's working by in the jvm
(12:38) itself okay so do you do you know like uh Java is 100% object oriented programming language or not yeah it's a programming language object okay so it is 100% object oriented or what yeah I think 100% of it programming okay so I think uh Java is partially objectoriented programming language no we cannot say like it's 100% because uh in Java language we have some primitive data types uh you saw like uh in these are not classes and object something like that so that's why Java is not 100% object orage okay yeah okay okay
(13:24) so uh in what situation uh did you decide to make classes method or variables finals uh can you please tell me yeah final Yeah final is a keyword once if you declare any variable in the final so we can be modified and if you can declare any method final method so we cannot be overridden like we cannot be inherited in the classes and then if you can declare class as a final so you cannot extend the class like like any other classes try to cannot create the object of the class case I just want to know like uh when the the same situation
(14:05) will come when we just want to use method as final so what's that situation which situation we have to use means so means what would be the use case I like like we know if method is declared as a final we cannot override it but yeah in what case in what situation so okay suppose if we creating any database Connections in that scenario we can use it that method so we need to create only one data database connection object so we can use that object to okay is it is it valid yeah it is I think valid so yeah go ahead uh now move move to the Vari
(14:53) variable find it so variable like if you can say so you property username passwords maybe okay EMP ID yeah security key something like that yeah mhm okay uh okay so uh have you used final keyword in your project anywhere like in class method or finally keyword I think maybe we declar for few methods only for two final methods only yeah not variable level okay so like uh can you describe any performance uh issues or consideration that we have related to using final class I mean uh is it increase the performance or decrease like you
(15:52) know performance rice Dees not sure I think okay so actually the use of final uh keyword allowed for compile time optimization like uh method in lining so which can lead to performance improvements by reducing call Overhead so yeah yes it is related to the performance also final key okay yeah it okay okay so uh can you please tell me about polymorphism yeah polymorphism like we can say like one name multiple forms like if the name itself consist volum means one and form is many one multiple forms we can declare suppose if you can
(16:36) take any list interface like the list interface have multiple classes implementation classes like AR list link list and Vector so here also we have two two types of polymorphism like one is compile time so we can achieve that overloading mechanism here and then another one is time polymorphism we can achieve in the war writing approaches here as well okay okay okay so can you please tell me an example where polymorphism solved a design problem or architecture level problem do you know arure level [Music] problem the scenario I think I'm not
(17:19) sure like where I have used in my project [Music] M I think in a reporting system I mean reporting system is Maybe one of the example so we for different types of reports to be uh generated using a single interfaces or something like it and there might multiple example so yeah no worries do you know about hashmap and hash set hashmap yeah hashmap and hash set hashit as well yeah yeah yeah I think set and map has map and has yes yeah can you explain so like yeah if you want to store in group of objects in the SC of
(18:05) key value PS so we can use that map map interface to EXT that class as a hashmap class okay and then here also in the hashmap D duplicate keys does not allow and duplicate values can be allow and then only one n key has be able to insert and then multiple n values can be able to insert in the hashmap and has set we can say here we so here also same thing so we can group of object we can okay a single entity like here we cannot insert the duplicate keys and then insertion insertion also not reserved here like this so how how they
(18:49) are working internally hashmap and headset do you know yeah internal hashmap yes I know so internally it ising the link list so like if any object of that hashmap so size should be 16 and it will be create in zero index to 15th index internally it will be create 16 array of buckets okay so every bucket has one node so internally node has a link list so whenever we trying to inserting any value while calling the method So based on the key hash code value based on sorry we put new value in the form of key value so key key hash
(19:29) code so we will get some an index and for that index we can able to insert that in the node so how in the link list also we first how we can story so first we hash code and then value key and value and then next one is pointing to the next node references so in this manner it is storing and then how you can s it is not index B not it is sequential inerting I think linear I think so you saidh app is based on link list right yeah uh in current Java versions as well yeah current Java version previously it has been using that link list previously it
(20:13) was uh implemented in the that on that I agree uh the latest version like Java 17 Java 11 and Java 8 also yeah that name impementation is changed Chang yes imp that was I can like starts with some red yeah red black tree H red black tree yeah yeah so yeah it was very I mean the complexity was slower uh in the through the link list okay so that that's why uh from the Java 8 onwards uh they have introduced red black internally in the hashmap uh now it is more efficient yeah so the two in the yeahh okay so can you tell me so which
(21:08) Java uh I mean which Java version you use like 8 11 17 or I think it's 1.8 only we are using the current project java8 yeah 1.8 still okay okay okay so what what all what what what are the new features that were introduced in Java that were that that was not pre available previously can you please tell me yeah I think I think we have multiple features in Java I mainly I have used one is that the streams and then optional option have used and Lambda expressions and then for the DAT date related operations for we are using
(21:46) daytime API so these four used yeah what's the what's the purpose of uh Java stream apis why they introduce yeah suppose if so by the streams we can perform multiple operations over here so basically we can collect the list of list of objects we can perform colle functional level programming we can we can Implement here so in the streams we have multiple methods like filter and map and collects and then here we by using these streams we can like mapping and filtering and reducing and sorting these techniques we
(22:26) can Implement here so if if you suppose if I I will give an example if you have one list of integers we we have so we can iterate through normal for Loop and enhanced for Loop or else for any for for each method as well so instead of implementing those traditional approach we have can use the streams as well here to iterate so sorry to filter that list of integers to find based on our condition suppose we have list of integers maybe we need to find in even numbers so then we can first we can filter that by using the filter method
(23:00) and then then if you want once we will filter that values then if we need to perform any other operations like once we will get that list of integers like sorry list of even numbers if we need to perform any other operations which means we need to double or else we need to multiply value so we can Implement that condition in the map interface by using some predicates as well so and then we this kind of operation we can perform so this operation we can use before can it is completely some approaches okay okay uh optimization is
(23:34) also increased like deficiency optimization okay okay so can you tell uh so as we previously discussed about hashmap right so can you tell me uh the I mean in the brief uh the description of HH code and equal method hash and equals yeah so internally it is we we they calling the hash code andal method so how it is working so suppose if you are trying to insert one putting one value key and value objects so first first it will get the hash code value of the key value so b b on once it get that key hash code and then it will
(24:16) find out find out that index value and then it will store into that node so that is one op so suppose if you're trying to insert another key it may be a suppose if you're okay previously I'm inserting one object and then second time I also inserting another object it may be written same hash code values for two objects yeah can assume two objects are raining same hash code value in that scen how we are inserting means so first you will get that index of that hash code values and then here internally
(24:44) equals method calls and it it will be verified so hash code values it will be same or not if it is Hash code values is same so it can we cannot insert so we here so we cannot insert the duplicate keys right so it won't be to insert the value so here internally hash code and it will be work out okay okay MH okay so uh one more thing so uh like in uh collection uh framework like hashmap uh link list list anyone why don't we uh use primitive data types in those like data types yeah I mean you see like we add like integer Capi
(25:32) n simple small in so why don't we use those primitive data types yeah suppose if you Crea any list object as well while performing any generics we have to pass the upper class like maybe string integer anything integers to flow to this cannot we Cann possible why means we can [Music] say so those can be PR to dats cannot yes okay yeah yeah so no problem moving to the different question so uh as you said you worked on apis right yeah we have consumed res so how will you secure uh apis or how do you secure apis yeah like
(26:21) whatever you are implementing the rest services oh yeah yeah rest Services yeah so we can we have Concept in the spring boot like Spring Security so while adding the Spring Security dependency we need to achieve that Spring Security for our in points like how means we have few annotations like we need to enable at enable annotations as well at enable security annotations at method level class level we have to declare and then we need to configure security configurations in Java level Java class level so here we have to implement
(26:56) extend when class is there we security adapter okay so here we can Implement our our logic as well so based what are the AP rest Services we are implementing so we can provide the security for them so based on that we have few authentications and authorizations as well soing is providing default form base authentications as well default log out approaches and then we can provide their permissions and by using the roles and permissions and so roles and permissions as well you can secure them okay so can we secure any method any
(27:31) only method if I want to secure a particular method yeah we have few as well like at method level we have an at pre-authorized and post authorized and at yeah at secure orations as well we have we can do and and then if you if you want to any authenticate authentications possible it's not only form based authentications we have some token based authentications as well like JW so we instead of following default form based we can customize our own login page as well so here as well you can do it okay so in your uh I'm not sure but maybe you
(28:13) have used some collection sort in your project like AR s sort collections s sort have you used somewhere I read a sorting technique not not it used but yeah can ask me anything I will try to okay so can you tell me like uh do you know about arrays do sort right so do you know the algorithm uh internally working on this method arrays.
(28:41) sort s internal and collections. sort collection sort no internal implementation of sort methods for arrays and collections no not here yeah so basically array. sort uses a d pivate quick sort algorithm okay uh like if we have primitive data types if we have uh like object arrays then it use team s whereas collection uh.
(29:10) sort algorithm uses uh Team sort only it's it's a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines merch sort and insertion sort both yeah okay yeah so do you know about web flx and mono in springboard webflex yeah web flex no not that used okay so web Flex is a reactive programming framework in Spring boot for building non-blocking web applications okay and mono is a reactive type in a web Flex representing a single or empty value uh it is used for as synchronous programming yeah okay okay uh okay so can you tell me the difference between controller annotation
(29:54) and rest controller annotation yeah test controller test controller in Spring MC we are using the controller anotations to make the class as a controller so we can declare controller an that controller so if we so this class is it returns maybe sorry the class has be return in the form of string objects internally it resolves the by user few VI resolvers we us at controller classes and at sorry in rest controller arations we are declaring class as at rest controller so then we can Implement our rest Services rest in
(30:37) point APS and then it come up with on top of it component like at controller and along with the response body as well okay and then if you yeah it returns and string and as a Jon object it will be return what are the methods that we have deed in the rest controller class it rest controller is a combination of controller and response body yeah com okay okay it both and objects as well okay okay so what are the best practices of rest API best practices while writing Rest apis what what are the best practices yeah like if you are
(31:14) implementing any rest Services suppose if you taking any basic C operations first you have to define the versioning techniques like if you are for suppose if you are developing implementing one versions one version of java and spring board techniques so first we need to at the class level versioning versioning URLs like V1 V2 V3 maybe in future we have to be upgrade our versions right so we have to follow approach and then we need to prepare what are the aps we are implementing we need to provide the documentation for that APS like
(31:45) swag that is one thing and then uh suppose we have any UI point of view so what kind of response they're accepting it may be XML it may be J so we need to Define we need to Define clear and Define ourself from back and side and then what type of and then what type of status we need to send out it may be success response if 200 or else 21 also we can able to send it and then 22 also you can able to send it for Success response but maybe name has been different and then we have to perform error validations and error response we
(32:18) need to take care and then if you have multiple apas in that apas we have any secure related AP instead of default H Pages we need to secure what are the test APS we implementing we need to secure by using some security mechanisms and then suppose if you I'm sending one request query to the database fetch all employees so I will get that all the employees details instead of displaying all the employees details to that front end or else in the post man so I will use some techniques like filter and sorting and Page Nations maybe how they
(32:51) are maintaining the front end side in the browser point of view so we will Implement our side as well like paging and sorting and these techniques we have to follow while that nice nice nice so yeah nice so moving ahead uh can you tell me the difference between component service and repository anotation service component service and repository and yeah yeah yeah so so first I will tell about the basically repositories we have to to perform any database reled operations so suppose we have an interface with that interface
(33:27) extending string some data JP repository so so if that is not Mand to declare the reposit Elations for the repositories so you want to declare you can able to declare but basically this is for the database perform operations to perform from PR def methods or else we can Implement some customes as well so we can maintain that logic in the repositories so we can assign so then we can identify this this interfaces maybe dis classes for repository section and then coming to the service layer so here we have have to maintain some completely
(33:59) business logic we to identify that business logic in the service layer and then component or else maybe it's controller so here we are maintaining the our request endpoint URLs so what what request is coming from the from browser point of view or else any Postman point of view that request HTTP request we have to handle the controller or maybe component classes so we can can we use uh component annotation on our service file uh or database files uh classes instead of service annotation can we use component annotation in
(34:38) service class yeah we can use it I think yeah because it means we can injecting the dependencies right so we can use it right we can use it but for practice like best practice veres we cannot declare like this we can Implement so why I mean why a best practice to use service annotation instead of component and service class even when component is also uh working thing like this okay so basically uh there is one thing uh component annotation is a like a generic thing okay we can use anywhere on service file or repository file but we use service
(35:25) annotation because it contains component annotation things as well plus some additional service file related things and errors on top of it yeah on top of it okay yeah okay so can you explain the spring Bean life cycle yeah spring Bean life cycle yeah here the responsible for creating the beans and creating the beans and destroying the beans so it will taken care by that like here few methods like in and Destroy as well so like in instantiations and MH we have been post processor also is there cly okay yes we have some
(36:07) annotations like post construct pred destroy all those stuff annotations [Music] yeah yes yeah okay okay so what are the uses of response entity response entity yeah so here suppose if you are hitting any database API or we sending any consuming any third party AP so we will get the some response so instead of maintaining one that response one object Java be class maybe any Java class we can maintain that response in the form of respon entity so in the response in the come of extra properties as well so those may be
(36:44) like HTTP status so this kind of information they have like body and head body just we need only the body of that response you will get the body message and they will render to the browser point of view along with we can send it the status codes as well okay so what should be the delete API method status code be delete method uh status code uh Delete method API status code let's say you have implemented a delete API right yeah what should uh you return the status code to the front end or anywhere in the code we will give some
(37:23) response delete successfully deleted something but status code we have a lot of multiple status sces right 200 500 500 series and 500 Series yeah so yes I just want to ask the status code for delete API delete successfully delete what I think success means can send it you can send it that 200 series response like status code yeah yes we can send we can send it but yeah so okay so the good practice is uh if the delete API is uh returning some response body the status code should be 200 if there is no content then it should be
(38:10) 2004 204 okay yeah okay something is returning so then we can send it as 200 response if not it is just we are giving this is a good practice only otherwise for every case we can return 200 that is okay thanks yeah so moving to the next question so uh have you handled uh timeout things while implementing an API time outs not yet I think let's say if API is taking more than 30 seconds or what so have you implemented something related to time out error threats we have I think no not yet implemented so do you know like uh if you get a chance
(38:57) how will you implement like we can use here the threads concept here which Concepts threads to improve improve the per API performance like cashing techniques as well M can use it I think I'm not sure on this we can use thread for just improving things but I'm saying like like if if API is failing uh I mean AP API is taking a lot of time so on that case uh how can we just uh how can we just understand like this API is taking time uh just now return some time out error so how would you implement this we have some circuit breakers uh I
(39:53) think we can Implement those yeah in micro service yeah micro service architect yeah instead of sending that error message we can send some fallback response as well yes yeah circuit break pattern implementation okay okay so okay so how does basic authentication work in rest API so basic authentications means uh yeah go ahead what were you saying like authentication basic authentication basic authentication means let's say if someone is creating a personal project or if someone is new into this uh securing API so basic yeah
(40:42) yeah for that first we need to identify the user by using some credentials maybe they have the username passwords so we can identify that users is then we can authenticate once the user is authenticated successfully then we can provide the access to the this responding Bas on their roles we can pro access for required URLs Like requ Ur okay okay so how how would you configure course policies in your spring boot application to accept cross origin request from a specific uh front end domain yeah I think I have faced an
(41:20) issue so we have an annotations at Cross origin annotation so here we need to pass that which is that I think adding this cross origin at the class level uh of the controller so we can get rid of this error this issues yeah we can use it level also right cross addition level I think I'm not sure on this uh can try yeah I think I heard about I think so that's right okay okay okay yeah then we'll try no no issue so yeah so this will help us to like reduce this issues and we can customize this as per our need
(42:09) let's say if we don't want to uh configure for all all the apis if we just want to include for some so we can configure it yeah so how would you secure sensitive data in a spring boot application that is accessed by multiple users with different roles sensitive data like which mean yeah there like sensitive data we can say suppose we have username passwords so maybe username we can able to expose but password we cannot be exposed to that any out outside so we have to store the maybe it's a database password it maybe
(42:46) any other passwords we can use in that we can to save so by using some encryption techniques we have like by bcrypt encoder password encoders we have made especially in that we have multiple ways like no password so it should be saving in the form of text format only so if you need to store our password in the form of encrypted manner we have bcrypt password encoder and so we need while validating we need to we can able to fch the password we can encrypt and then we will validate by using the password as well so this so did you get
(43:18) a chance to implement encryption and decryption things in any of the project so not in the client project personally I have implementing on applications so here I'm using this technique like so initially I have used the no password only for my basic authentications so later I have choosen that vry password encoder so do you know about cryptographic hashing cryptography no not yet okay okay no M uh and are you familiar with any specific tools or practices for monitoring uh logs yeah for monitoring locks I have
(43:59) knowledge on the like elastic search as well to moning the locks exceptional locks yeah I have the only basic idea about that exception elastic search how it is working but not real time experience like not real time experience not real time okay no worries uh but but one thing so in your project how do you monitor logs let's say if some issue come so you don't need to check the codes before checking the Cod check the logs yeah yeah as I mentioned just we are deploying the v file in that remote server so here there is no code so just
(44:35) if you have any issue with that any production any de environment so just we need to go through that log files so we are generating the log files in that machine itself on separate directory so first we need to go through that log files then we need to identify the issue where it is got so then we will come back to that our local machines then we will overcome that issue maybe so it's what that we need to find that Ro cost then we need to identify then we need to resolve that issue then again we need to
(45:01) deploy the v file same that machine okay so so how do you manage dependencies in a maven project dependencies yeah MAV projects we are using the P pom file right so here we are declaring the required dependencies few of them are using the some stter dependencies as well and some normal dependencies like the tools and we are connecting to the database myql connector as well we are add the form of dependencies so do you know about the class path yes yeah class path so what are the dependen that we are adding so
(45:34) it should be come up with in the form of class path it will be added to the class path okay okay so how would you R A changes in a git if you accidentally pushed a bug to the main branch yeah okay so first we okay it means we have already committed course in the main yeah excident accidentally so first we here we can use the rebase no we will get the latest commit so Bas on the commit ID we can rever the changes some rebase commands are is there get rebase and commit the easiest way is to just go to the GitHub or G
(46:17) laab wherever you have committed and just go to the options and R but through the commands uh we need to write some commands so uh can you tell me those comments yeah comments you have head and get head find the next exactly not sure not collecting that command okay so we can use a get rever command to create commit yeah get we have to pause it right yeah yeah yeah for that reason we are so we are individually we are creating the multiple branches so we are maintaining this like instead of okay that go to the main branch indidual branches for that
(47:10) reason no no issues what H yes yeah just I'm collecting the commentary what okay so what is the purpose of unit testing in software development life cycle yeah we have that few test cases as well complete applications as for the development point of view we need to perform basic you know testing is it required to perform so then we can ident then we can able to say that what are the aps that we have implemented so those end points has been executed successfully some like sample data can able to identify before going to that any
(47:51) testing environment so it is required to implement as in the in the point of development point of s is it requir to implement it has to requ I think okay okay so uh one more thing Krishna so you have eclipse in your uh machine yeah I any any editor any ID yeah STDs we are using STS okay so I'm just sharing you some code uh two coding problem one by one and you just uh need to share your screen okay and you just need to write the code and run yeah sure can you share your screen and open any editor online editor is
(48:39) also fine your system is not working properly so let me tell you let me I mean tell me the solutions verbally so let me repeat question again okay so the first question is uh you have you are given an array uh containing zero and ones only okay you your your task is to keep all zeros on the left hand side and all ones on the right hand side so how will you solve this problem in Javas so it means we are we need to sort that array so we can use that sorting Tech sorting methods so we can can simply can method so it will come up
(49:18) with the first zeros and then but but but the time complexities would be o and login right yeah so wece it okay so we can use some iteration supp by using the F Loop we can able to iterate so using some thought but another one temporary variable so now how will you use uh I mean solve this by iterating uh can you please explain yeah okay I will I will try to write the code I think now it's opening uhhuh yeah I will share my screen yeah so so just I'm taking one
(50:26) as this is AR I'm taken so we can use that sort method as well so instead of sort method we can use some by using F we can able toate so I will take one temporary variable okay we can use S method but that will lead to higher complexities yeah higher comp we can use some normal for loop I will get that first itations yeah so then I will take it another loop for here
(51:31) another integers so here how I'm verifying means so sorry here I need to take I plus plus one I think plus two so why are you taking two Loops uh because if you again use two Loops then again uh the code will lead to higher complexities right that's why we just don't want to use sting algorithm because of higher complexities so instead of two Loops okay uh I just giving you a hint try using uh one Loop can we solve through only one Loop only one Loop can we can we count uh something here and store can we count one how many ones are there
(52:31) and zeros are there in storing the different variables yes yes and then print the one uh uh as per their count and zero as per their count print first one then print second zero or uh putting into the array another array uh no no in the same array so what I'm trying to say is let's say you have this arrrow right it is containing 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 okay we can do we can start we can initialize two counter variables first is count one second is Count zero count one is uh storing the values of one like how many
(53:17) times one is coming occurring and count zero is counting zeros okay so in this Loop we will check I mean like we can do like if a i is equal to is equal to 1 so we can increase a count one if a i is equal to is equal to Z we can increment the count zero so by ending of this Loop we we we we will be knowing how many ones are there and how many zeros are there okay did you get it yeah and then again in the second Loop uh we will uh derse the array and first first we will try to finish the count one because count one means how
(54:02) many times one are there and we will decrease count one one by one let's say we will add a z one and then we will decrease one value from the count value count one value did you got it just got it but somewhat confusing is there so if okay first I will find that number of ones as how many are there so we need to store any array or else just you need to store only one one integer variable integer variable so see let's say uh you have count one variable you have count zero variable count one will be uh four because we have four ones
(54:47) zero will be four because we have zero or four zeros four times will be increment okay four time and now uh we will use y Loop and inside the while loop we can put count 1-us okay so means when we have count when we have uh I mean count is greater than zero we will go into the while loop otherwise no and until it becomes zero we will put value one into the array from starting and then we will go to the second while loop that is for count zero so by doing this I think we can solve this problem by o algorithm yeah okay no problem now moving to the
(55:35) next question uh uh you have to find the duplicate element and it occurrs in a given string using Java streams can you solve this into the Java streams by using Java streams okay suppose if you have one string okay uh just forget about occurrences just uh find the duplicate elements only duplicates characters yeah duplicate characters yeah okay simp I or or or just just return how many duplicate elements are there count we can able to display yeah yeah yeah okay you can use normal for Loops as well over here can
(56:31) Implement suppose if I will take it one here I'm taking string we have multiple duplicate characters there m so here also we can take two for Loops to combin we can we solve this through Java streams API Java stream apis like do filter map dot this are you familiar yeah steams are there but
(57:37) here finding exact duplicate characters okay just then I can use normal for Loops here we can okay I will try try is Ty this one yeah yeah okay I will Ty I need to get that I need to get one [Music] character getting every character storing one
(58:55) character [Music] that's St getting with ctive first one if character verifying every character then
(59:59) comparing the two characters first character B and then next character J first will be V comparing every V character has to [Music] be yeah okay so I understood I your approach I think we can print here you are just trying two Loops can see what is the okay [Music] equal but character not so CH is a character and you are comparing like CS as an error yes yeah I need to so it should be CH is equal to equal to Str
(1:01:03) Str uh of J carat of I yes we can compare like this s Str of I okay so that is fine I just understood what you are trying to do yes you are using two loops and for each character you are finding the duplicate character okay yes so that is fine uh but we can also solve this problem with I think map map yeah yeah map uh it is also fine but map is also fine uh we can just some code and things okay yes sure okay uh yes
